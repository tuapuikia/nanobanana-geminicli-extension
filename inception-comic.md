This is a comic about Inception. 

# character

- **Stan (Protagonist)**: 
  - **Face**: Follow the facial features in `characters/stan-portrait.png` strictly (sharp eyes, defined jawline, contemplative expression).
  - **Hair**: Tidy, short black hair, slightly swept to the side.
  - **Apparel**: A professional yet artistic black suit jacket over a crisp white dress shirt (no tie). This outfit must be consistent in every panel.
  - **Consistency Rule**: Maintain these exact features (hair, face, clothing) across all 12 panels without variation.

### Visual Continuity Rule
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To ensure absolute visual consistency in character likeness, art style, and environments, every new page generation **MUST** include two key reference images:
> 1. **Character Reference**: `characters/stan-portrait.png` (for strict face/outfit consistency).
> 2. **Previous Page Reference**: The immediately preceding generated page (e.g., use Page 1 when generating Page 2).
> This combination ensures both the character model and the artistic style/line weight remain locked across the entire comic.

# story

## Page 1 (6 Panels)

1. **Panel 1**: High-angle shot. Stan is standing in front of a large window, looking out at the Singapore City Marina Bay Sand. He is wearing a black suit and a white shirt.
2. **Panel 2**: Close-up on Stan's face. He is taking a sip from a cup of coffee, looking contemplative.
3. **Panel 3**: Stan sits down at his messy desk, filled with drawing pens and papers. He picks up a stylus/pen with purpose.
4. **Panel 4**: Action shot of Stan's hand drawing feverishly. Dynamic speed lines surround the pen. He looks focused, a single sweat bead on his forehead.
5. **Panel 5**: Focus on the finished drawing: it depicts an intense **angry mob at night**, with dozens of hands holding lit torches and pitchforks, and a large hand in the foreground pointing. (refer to `assets/drawing1.jpg`)
6. **Panel 6**: Stan looks frustrated, he crumbles a piece of paper. Several crumpled paper balls are already on the floor around his chair.

## Page 2 (6 Panels)

1. **Panel 1**: Stan is standing up and stretching his arms over his head, looking exhausted after an all-nighter.
2. **Panel 2**: Stan grabs a coffee cup with a prominent **Ubisoft** logo on it. He needs fuel to finish.
3. **Panel 3**: Stan sits back down, his eyes are sharp and determined. He starts a new drawing.
4. **Panel 4**: Stan continue to draw the 2nd page with intense focus. The "inception" feeling starts to kick in as the lines of his drawing seem to swirl around him.
5. **Panel 5**: Focus on the finished second drawing: it shows a **young woman with long dark hair, bound tightly to a wooden stake** with thick ropes, her face filled with terror. (refer to `assets/drawing2.jpg`)
6. **Panel 6**: **Final image**: Stan is holding both the **"Angry Mob"** drawing (from Panel 5, Page 1) and the **"Woman Tied to Stake"** drawing (from Panel 5, Page 2) in his hands. These drawings should be clearly visible and match the content described earlier. Stan looks at them with a wide, satisfied smile.
